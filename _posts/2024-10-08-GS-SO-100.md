This is an introductory blog that takes you on a journey starting all the way from the CAD model of a robot to training an agent in simulation and deploying a pre-trained policy back on the real robot.

- Start from CAD (SolidWorks) to URDF
- Importing URDF into Isaac Sim/USD Composer
- Adding Sensors and Actuators in Isaac
- System Identification
- Training a basic policy
- Sim2Real & Deployment
