How do you ensure that a reinforcement learning (RL)-based locomotion policy produces a natural and efficient gait? This project is particularly close to my heart because it helped me answer this question I’ve had since I first started working on locomotion policies in RL. In this blog, I’ll walk you through an approach that can help you move beyond tedious reward tuning and instead focus on achieving the perfect gait for your robot—without the frustration.
