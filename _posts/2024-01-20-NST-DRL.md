How do you ensure the gait looks good in a RL based locomotion policy ?
The following project is very close to my heart since it answered a question in RL based control I had since I first started working on locomotion policies. Follow along this blog to find out how you can probably switch from finetuning rewards to nailing the perfect gait for your robot without breaking a sweat.
